			.Net core vs .Net framework 
	
		.Net Framework
			Available only for windows
				Visual Studio (Licence cost) - high 
				Windows OS (Licence)
				Windows Server 

				This is costly
			Additionally, challange with ASP.Net framework
			Not made for responsive web
			Not following any Design pattern
			challanges with maintainance, internal technical challanges etc..

			integration with cloud apps and services
	------------This is not looking good 
		Agaist this, we have
				Angular, React, Node, -- free everywhere
							 cross platform
							 open source
							 developement for todays world
				VIM, Sublime, Note++ - all free and available everywhere
				NodeJS - host free anywhere, very fast web server
	
	--------------------------------------------
		Thus a complete write, .net core
			++integration with cloud apps and services
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Demo
		Create a .net core MVC app, on any platform, using .Net Core CLI
			Create, Build, run and test

			
			dotnet --version
			dotnet new mvc --name firstcoreMVC 
			dotnet build
			dotnet run
			
		open the same with VS Code and make changes from there

	Try the same 

		dotnet cli commands
