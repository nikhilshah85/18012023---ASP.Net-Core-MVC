MVC
EF Core
DI and Data annotation
Consume Service data - RESTAPI Service - (webapi in .net)
		Service is all about data, been shared by client
		This is JSON data, you need to consume the data and disply them in View
	(One of the major activity WebDeveloper/MVC developer does)

	There are 2 ways to make API calls
	1. Useing standard Fetch API - obj of browser 
		known as client side calls - uses Javascript 
		This is the fastest way to get the data
		less secure and not suitable for critical data like - login, credit card etc.
	2. useing standard HttpClient object
		known as server side calling
		a bit slow than above 1, but safest
